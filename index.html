            <p>I was a confused person. Even didn't beileve in myself. But I tried, I tried to build myself. Tried to
                change myself from confused to confident that I also can do. And see, now I'm implementing this website.

                They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
                it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.

                <p>It was a revolutionary part for my way to fly. I've learned there PHP and Laravel for four months. In
                    this time I've seen the actual working environment. It helped me to dream about my future fly.
